# Prime Tester (Sieve of Erastosthenes)

A testbed for me to practice some Rust!

TODO:
- [x] Implement Sieve of Erastosthenes for calculating a list of primes, counting primes, and largest prime
- [x] Write unit tests for core methods, using `primal` library
- [x] Write CLI interface for interacting with the sieve, using `clap` library
